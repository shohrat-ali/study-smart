<h1 style="text-align:right;"> Architecture &amp; Town Planning </h1> 
	<p class="rig"> Architecture has to do with planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology, and of light and shadow. Often, conflicting requirements must be resolved. Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimation and construction administration. Documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, defines the structure and/or behaviour of a building or other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Chemical </h1> 
	<p class="left">  Chemical Engineering a branch of engineering that applies the natural 
                        (or experimental) sciences and life sciences together with mathematics and 
                        economics to produce, transform, transport, and properly use chemicals, 
                        materials and energy. It essentially deals with the engineering of chemicals, 
                        energy and the processes that create and/or convert them. Modern chemical 
                        engineers are concerned with processes that convert raw-materials or (cheap) 
                        chemicals into more useful or valuable forms. In addition, they are also 
                        concerned with pioneering valuable materials and related techniques â€“ which are 
                        often essential to related fields such as nanotechnology, fuel cells and 
                        bioengineering. Within chemical engineering, two broad subgroups include design, 
                        manufacture, and operation of plants and machinery in industrial chemical and 
                        related processes ("chemical process engineers") and development of new or 
                        adapted substances for products ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics to 
                        cleaners to pharmaceutical ingredients, among many other products.

<h1 style="text-align:right;"> Civil </h1> 
	<p class="rig"> Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, 
                        construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, 
                        including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. Civil engineering is the 
                        second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to 
                        distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. It is traditionally broken 
                        into several sub-disciplines including architectural engineering, environmental engineering, 
                        geotechnical engineering, geophysics, geodesy, control engineering, structural engineering, 
                        transportation engineering, earth science, atmospheric sciences, forensic engineering, municipal 
                        or urban engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, offshore engineering, 
                        quantity surveying, coastal engineering, surveying, and construction engineering.
